OMG, bro, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 G20 and let me tell you, it's like a circus in suits. I mean, they all try to play it cool, but you can totally see through the whole act, you feel me? One moment they're shaking hands, big smiles, and the next... bam! Back to side-eyeing each other like it's some kinda high school drama. Seriously, it's ridiculous but also kinda entertaining in a ‘what the heck am I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨’ way.

> Also, did you catch how none of them can ever give a straight answer? Like, yo, just say it, you know? But no, let's dance around the topic for 10 minutes instead. It’s like, just spill the tea already! 😂 Anyway, this thing's so long, feels like I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a trilogy. Need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   sometime and compare the dialogues LOL.

And ugh, I don't even know why I stayed up for this, my brain's fried. But hey, at least I got a few laughs out of it. Oh, and there was that dude who almost tripped on stage, mannn, I legit had to pause and rewind that part. Classic! Who even thought that framing up a formal political meet could be this wild? They should just scrap the speeches and get them to rap battle or something. Bet that’d solve all world problems in an instant hahaha

So yeah, now I'm just here, thinking if I should’ve just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   instead, but meh, what’s done is done. Trying to shake off the political hangover by venting here. I don't get it, man, they talk like they're the Avengers or something, but most of them are just Tony Stark without the swag.

int main() { return 0; }

Anyway, dude, hit me up if you wanna hang or whatever. I've had enough of the suits for one day. Let's just laugh about this craziness over some pizza or something. Peace out! 🍕
